# A Naive GPU Implementation of Material Point Method

![Hello, MPM!](./figs/hello_mpm.png)

## Tested Environment

- Operating System: Windows Subsystem for Linux (Windows 11, Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS)
- CPU: 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-13900HX
- RAM: 32GB
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Laptop
- Softwares:
    - CUDA 12.4 WSL

## Dependencies

- You have to manually install on your machine:
    - CUDA (version 12.5 may not work)
    - OpenVDB
- CMake will automatically fetch:
    - GLFW
    - glad
    - Eigen
    - yaml-cpp
    - glm
    - Dear ImGui
- Download this hearder-only library using git submodule:
    - 3x3_SVD_CUDA ([my adapted version](https://github.com/H-YWu/3x3_SVD_CUDA) from [Fast CUDA 3x3 SVD](https://github.com/kuiwuchn/3x3_SVD_CUDA))

## Build & Run

1. build the project (check [the issue section](#known-issues) first if you encounter any problem):

```bash
mdkir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j8
```

2. copy the three directories _./config_, _./shader_ and _./data_ to the directory _./build/src/demo/_

3. goto _./build/src/demo/<program_dir>_ and run:

```bash
./<executable> ../config/<config_file_name>
```

## Render

### Online

I simply use OpenGL to render material points as points.

### Offline

In each frame, the program write the density grid to a _.vdb_ file, then I use Houdini to render the OpenVDB volume, please see [this repository](https://github.com/H-YWu/mpm_data) for details.

## Known Issues

- You may encounter "duplicated reinstall targets" when configuring the project, I simply comment out the reinstall target line in _\_deps/eigen-src/CMakelists.txt_ and reconfigure to address it.
- CUDA OpenGL interop is not supported yet on WSL according to [CUDA on WSL User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html#features-not-yet-supported), so I implemented CPU-version functions to write particles data for rendering.
- Util the last time I update this repository, CUDA kernels using `Eigen` cannot be compiled by `nvcc` with MS Visual Studio, according to [Using Eigen in CUDA kernels](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicCUDA.html). However, it might work in the future, so I also configured Windows OS in _CMakeLists.txt_. Hopefully this will be fixed soon!
- Currently there will be some errors if you compile this code with CUDA 12.5.
